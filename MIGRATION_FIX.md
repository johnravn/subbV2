# Fixing Local Supabase Migration Issues

## Problem

Your migrations assume base tables (`companies`, `jobs`, etc.) exist, but they were never created in migration files. This happens when you start using migrations after the database already exists.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Pull Base Schema (Recommended)

Pull the complete schema from your remote database to create a base migration:

```bash
# This will create a migration with all existing tables
npx supabase db pull

# If there are migration history conflicts, you may need to:
# 1. Link to remote first
npx supabase link --project-ref tlpgejkglrgoljgvpubn

# 2. Then pull
npx supabase db pull
```

### Option 2: Work with Remote for Now

For now, you can:
1. Skip local Supabase setup
2. Use the remote database directly
3. Your `.env.local` already points to remote

Then later, when you have time:
- Pull the base schema
- Set up local development properly

### Option 3: Manual Base Migration

Create a base migration manually with essential tables. This is more work but gives you full control.

## Quick Fix for Now

Since you're just getting started, the easiest path is:

1. **Use remote database** (you're already set up for this)
2. **Fix migrations later** when you have time to pull the base schema

Your app will work fine with the remote database. Local development is optional but nice to have.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fixed the `activity_type` enum migration
2. ⏳ Need to pull base schema or create base migration
3. ⏳ Then local Supabase will work

For now, you can continue developing against the remote database!
